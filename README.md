# Datsnvim

### Description

Those are just mine personal settings for neovim. I'm using it on my daily basis, so it's not a big deal if you want to use it too. I'm using it on a Linux system.

It's a very simple setup, no hard configurations, just a few plugins and some keybindings. But, if you're too new to vim, I recommend you to use [LunarVim](https://github.com/lunarvim/lunarvim) or something like that.

### Installation

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/datsfilipe/datsnvim.git' $HOME/.config/nvim

nvim .
```
