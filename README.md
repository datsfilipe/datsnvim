# Neovim cfg

Took a lot of the config from [Conscious](https://github.com/Manas140/Conscious) (which is a nice neovim minimal configuration, but I wanted it even more minimal), and from [Nyoom.nvim](https://github.com/shaunsingh/nyoom.nvim), which one that is a minimal config too and have the best look and feel.
